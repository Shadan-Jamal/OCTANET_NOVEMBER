        info: `The Amazon Rainforest, often called the "lungs of the Earth," spans over 5.5 million square kilometers across nine South American countries, with the majority in Brazil. This lush ecosystem is home to around 10% of all known species, including countless plants, animals, and insects. It plays a critical role in regulating the planet's oxygen and carbon dioxide levels, absorbing vast amounts of CO₂ and helping to mitigate climate change.
        The Amazon is rich in biodiversity, with iconic species like jaguars, sloths, macaws, and the Amazon River dolphin. It also supports numerous indigenous communities who have lived in harmony with the forest for thousands of years, relying on it for food, medicine, and shelter. However, the rainforest faces significant threats from deforestation, mining, and agriculture, which endanger its delicate balance and vital role in the global ecosystem.`
